# About - WorldHeritages 🌟
An android app for helping people discover W​orld Heritages​ around the planet. The UI of this app is built using Jetpack Compose. This is a practice app that helped me to learn more about Jetpack Compose as well as Jetpack Components alongside their implementation details.
